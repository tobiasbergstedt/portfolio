        I'm <span class="blue-color larger-font">Tobias</span>, a Front End
        Developer and Graphic Designer based in
        <span class="blue-color">Kungsbacka, Sweden</span>. I'm especially
        passionate about the graphical aspect of web development, and about
        building easy-to-use applications that still solves the various complex
        challenges of today, manages to engage the end user, and looks good.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been creating stuff on the web for the last 15, or so, years.
        Primarily for personal use, but also for family and friends. I
        <span class="blue-color">love being creative</span> and seeing visions
        come to life in new, exciting ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last few years, I've been working with a professional sports club
        from Sweden, called Frilles√•s Bandy. There, I've been
        <span class="blue-color">Head of Graphic Design</span>, responsible for
        the <span class="blue-color">design</span> and creation of marketing
        material for web and print,
        <span class="blue-color">original artwork</span> for merchandise as well
        as a number of other projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        On my free time, I encourage my creative side in my
        <span class="blue-color">woodworking shop</span>, where I create custom
        designed furniture and smaller pieces of kitchenware. I also like to
        maintain an active lifestyle, which I do by
        <span class="blue-color">playing bandy</span> (a winter sport, played on
        ice) as well as running and inline skating in the summer.
